# Contribute to the project



## Start Points

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TGM-HIT/syt5-gek1051-mobile-application-budgeteer.git
```

3. Head to the shopping-list-borko directory (`cd shopping-list-borko`).

```bash
cd shopping-list-borko
```

4. Install npm dependencies:

```
npm install
```

4. Start the application:

```
npm start
```


5. With the application startet, the shopping list is available under `localhost:8081`.


## API Entry Points

### Initialize PouchDB

```
// this will be the PouchDB database
var db = new PouchDB('shopping');
```
Here you can see how we create a PouchDB Database with the name "shopping". The changes made locally are saved in this database and will be synced with the CouchDB database, when a connection is established.

### Templates

```
// template shopping list object
const sampleShoppingList = {
	"_id": "",
	"type": "list",
	"version": 1,
	"title": "",
	"checked": false,
	"place": {
		"title": "",
		"license": null,
		"lat": null,
		"lon": null,
		"address": {}
	},
	"createdAt": "",
	"updatedAt": ""
};

// template shopping list item object
const sampleListItem = {
	"_id": "",
	"type": "item",
	"version": 1,
	"title": "",
	"checked": false,
	"createdAt": "",
	"updatedAt": ""
};
```
Here you can see the shema for the two objects "sampleListItem" and "sampleshoppinglist". This shema shows, which data is needed and will be filled with data later.

## Sorting Functions

```
/**
 * Sort comparison function to sort an object by "createdAt" field
 *
 * @param  {String} a
 * @param  {String} b
 * @returns {Number}
 */
const newestFirst = (a, b) => {
	if (a.createdAt > b.createdAt) return -1;
	if (a.createdAt < b.createdAt) return 1;
	return 0 
};

/**
 * Sort comparison function to sort an object by "createdAt" field
 *
 * @param  {String} a
 * @param  {String} b
 * @returns {Number}
 */
const checkedItem = (a, b) => {
	if (a.checked < b.checked) return -1;
	if (a.checked > b.checked) return 1;
	return 0 
};
```
These functions are used to sort the Items. The first function "newestFirst" uses the createdAt Data from an object to determine which Item was created first.
The function "checkedItem" checks with the check Data from an object if a item is checked.

## Ajax Request Function

```
/**
 * Perform an "AJAX" request i.e call the URL supplied with the 
 * a querystring constructed from the supplied object
 *
 * @param  {String} url 
 * @param  {Object} querystring 
 * @returns {Promise}
 */
const ajax = function (url, querystring) {
```
This function makes a Ajax Request to a URL to get Data from external Databases. 

## Testing with Cypress

# Testing mit Cypress

With Cypress you can make tests for JavaScript

- Configure Tests
- Write Tests (from end user perspective, checking API calls, isolated tests without backend)
- Run tests and debug
- Evaluate tests

Install directly in the Project Path with:

```shell
npm install cypress --save-dev
```
Head to the shopping-list directory:

```shell
cd shopping-list-borko
```

Then open Cypress

```shell
npx cypress open
```

Now select the test type -> configuration files will be created -> Select browser and start testing

The test cases are saved in so-called specs. Describe() describes a series of test cases and it() is the heading of each test case.
Example:

With cy.visit you can visit a page:

``describe('template spec', () => {`

  `it('Visits Shopping List Webapp', () => {`

â€‹    `cy.visit('https://genuine-bublanina-389900.netlify.app/')`

  `})`

`})``

## Additional Infos

Automated actions run on the main branch which deploy the app. To get your changes through, please file a pull request.

### Commit Messages

We would like to remind you of how to write Commit-Messages. There are certain websites which can help you write good Commit-Messages[1].

To summarize the Website a little bit, you should always start the Commit Message with a Verb like "Add", "Remove", etc. and then summarize the Work you have done. 

## Branch Rules

### Main Branch
- Contains all the code and description of the project.

### Pull Requests

- To implement your changes to the main branch, you have to create a Pull Request.
- The Pull Request has to be reviewed by one contributor of the team, before the changes will be intergrated
