# Budgeteer - the free shopping list to manage your budget

## Intro

We all have experienced it at some point: A forgotten piece of paper lying on our desk while we, straying in the supermarket, wonder what we wanted to buy. 
Then we remember our shopping list app we downloaded yesterday, but it is riddled with ads, and it cannot sync my list in the far corners of the supermarket 
because it has no offline support.

Budgeteer solves these issues with on- and offline synchronisation as well as being a free program.

## Start Points

To start the shopping list application, you have to head to the shopping-list-borko directory (cd shopping-list-borko). After you changed your directory you have 
to execute the command "npm install". This command installs all npm modules required for this application. After you've installed all the modules execute the command "npm start"
and access your application in the browser with the address "localhost:8081".
