## Intro

We all have experienced it at some point: A forgotten piece of paper lying on our desk while we, straying in the supermarket, wonder what we wanted to buy. 
Then we remember our shopping list app we downloaded yesterday, but it is riddled with ads, and it cannot sync my list in the far corners of the supermarket 
because it has no offline support.

Budgeteer solves these issues with on- and offline synchronisation as well as being a free program.

## Start Points
